Issue in Q1 is what is known as Diamond problem i.e. multiple inheritance. As we can see in the uml diagram that both Batsman and Bowler 
class inherit from Cricketer class till this it is fine but as we move down in the class diagram there is an All rounder class which 
inherits both Batsman and Bowler class due to which the multiple inheritance issue arises. Java doesn't allow multiple inheritance so
compiler will automatically give us an error but why java doesn't allow us to do us ? it is because of conflict as when a class inherits
from multiple classes those multiple class can have same functions in them so when we create the object of that subclass and call the function
that both the inherited classes have in them the compiler will not know which classes function to call. So this was the problem that
we are encountering in the given um diagram.
